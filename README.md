# Sea Framework
This is a private framework made by Masea specifically for his own CS2D projects. It is not allowed to be used by anyone else unless Masea has allowed so.
Anyhow, it is firmly not recommended to use this framework without reading the documentation entirely as this highly modifies CS2D.

What this framework aims to do is to transform every single game entity (note that it is not only the map entities but also players, items, tiles and more) to a class to make OOP possible with the metatable feature Lua provides. So the parameters of hooks (renamed as events) are now actual objects instead of IDs. This framework also stands as a "workspace" where you can locate yours apps (mods & scripts) in a folder and then let the framework run them upon a server start to make your CS2D directory even more organized. Briefly, creating mods with this, even the largest ones, is just easy and clean. You will not be dealing with the common stuff that you do every single time you start modding a new project.

The name comes from my nickname, the last three letters of "Masea", if you are curious to know.
