# Sea Framework
This is a private framework made by Masea specifically for his CS2D projects. Using this framework without reading the documentation entirely is not recommended as this highly modifies CS2D. 

What this framework aims to do is to transform every single game entity (note that it is not only the map entities but also players, items, tiles, and more) to a class to make OOP possible with the metatable feature Lua provides. So the parameters of hooks (renamed as events) are now actual objects instead of bare IDs. This framework also stands as a "workspace" where you can locate your apps (mods & scripts) in a folder and then let the framework run them up on a server start to make your CS2D directory even more organized. Briefly, creating mods with this, even the largest ones, is just easy and clean. You will not be dealing with the common stuff you do every time you start modding a new project.

The name comes from my nickname, the last three letters of "Masea", if you are curious to know.
